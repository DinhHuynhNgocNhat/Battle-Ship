This assignment is about creating an OO model of the game Battleship (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)). 
The goal for the initial version of the program is to replace the sheet of paper, i.e. a player can use the program to arrange 
his ships, keep track of the opponent’s shots, and keep track of the results of his own shots. You won’t implement a 
multi-player game. The user of your program will still have to talk to his opponent, who can continue to use a sheet of paper
